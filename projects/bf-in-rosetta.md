This is a collaboration project between my self and Jasper (Fallstop), making too many brainf**k interpreters. A full 
list of currently functional languages is available on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fallstop/bf-in-rosetta). It
started after we had a competition to make the fastest interpreter in rust. Then we made a PHP version, running on an
old tablet, available [here](http://brainfucked.qrl.nz). We then made a few more. You can add some of your own if you 
want as well.
