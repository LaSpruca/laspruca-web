You probably think that by buying an electric car, you're no longer burning fossil fuels to power you commute, however, what if the power coming from your walls wasn't coming from renewable and was instead creating large amounts of greenhouse gasses? Would you still charge you car? Would you still put the drier on? Would you still run your AC? If the answer to any of those questions was _no_ then, you may be interested in Dirty Watts. Dirty watts is a project developed for [GovHack 2022](https://govhack.org). The aim of this project is to put some light on where NZ's power generation is coming from, and more importantly, how clean it is. It consists of two main parts, a dashboard to show all some statist's about power consumption and generation, and a IoT light, that warns you when dirty power is being employed.
