				I'm a second-year Software Engineering student at the University of Auckland who spends way

				Ever since I was young, I have wanted to work with computers until I was in intermediate
				school, when I discovered coding. From then on, it was pretty clear what I wanted to do.
				Since then, I have been hacking away at my own silly little projects until I found my group
				of people at a little community group in Whangārei called<a

					class="rounded-sm bg-glass p-1 text-primary backdrop-blur-[15rem]"
					>Questionable Research Labs</a
				>. Through Questionable Research Labs, I found a group of like-minded people to work on my
				silly little projects together. In addition to providing me with space to work on projects
				with friends, QRL also introduced me to hackathons, with my first hackathon being
				<a

					class="rounded-sm bg-glass p-1 text-primary backdrop-blur-[15rem]">GovHack</a
				>
				way back in 2019. As well as GovHack, me and my friends also like to participate in
				<a

					class="rounded-sm bg-glass p-1 text-primary backdrop-blur-[15rem]">KiwiJam</a
				>
				and

				Nowadays, I am studying software engineering at the University of Auckland, and I'm in my
				second year. I also work alongside my studies with two main jobs, one for a startup called
				<a

					class="rounded-sm bg-glass p-1 text-primary backdrop-blur-[15rem]">Fathomiser</a

				Outside of all my studing, working and hackathoning, I still enjoy my own personal projects.
				As well as that, I really enjoy field hockey, and swimming. Both of which I have take a bit
				of a break from, but am looking into getting back into next year and late this year
				repectively. I also really love to learn about things across a wide array of topics.
				Sometimes it's the amazon rainforest, others, it's the economic effects of building more
				toll roads in City Skylines. The topics that I have the most interest though are public
				transport, especailly trains, avatian, and software development.
